In the 1970s and 1980s Choose Your Own Adventure books were very popular. They were paperback novels which had 
fragments of stories of scattered across pages. On the bottom of each page was a choice or an ending. Once you read the
fragment which often projected you into a mystical world fraught with peril, you could choose what you could do next. 
This was done by giving you a list of choices with page numbers. You would then navigate to that page and carry on 
your adventure.

This project attempts to reinvent that experience with a system where users can:

- create, collaborate, and build their own choose your own adventure stories.
- add new choices at any time.
- accompany stories with images, or videos, or sounds.
- browse available stories to explore.
- add-on to existing stories.
- cache some of the stories to read offline.
