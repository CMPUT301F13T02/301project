	        Welcome to Choose Your Adventure. <br /><br />
        
	        In this page of the application you can read a single page of a story. <br /><br />
	        
	        At the bottom of the story, you will see an ending followed by a thick grey line. The ending is followed
	        by a set of decisions, each one followed by a thin grey line. To choose a decision, simply press on it
	        &mdash; doing so will take you to a new page where you will learn the consequences of your actions. <br /> <br />
	        
	        Don&apos;t forget to leave comments if you enjoyed this page! Comments are from the readers of the story
	        and are found at the bottom of the page under the &ldquo;Comments&rdquo; header. To add a comment press the
	        &ldquo;+ Add a Comment&rdquo; button. <br /> <br />
	        
	        If this is your story, you will see an &ldquo;Edit&rdquo; action on the android bar at the top of the screen.
	        Press this to enter the edit mode and change what readers will see on this page. <br /> <br />

	        Welcome to Choose Your Adventure. <br /><br />
        
	        In this page of the application you can edit a single page of your story. <br /><br />
	        
	        A story is composed of &ldquo;tiles&rdquo; which are arranged vertically down the screen. There are four types
	        of tiles:
	    	
	    	<ol>
	    		<li> Text tiles </li>
	    		<li> Picture tiles (Coming Soon!)</li>
	    		<li> Audio tiles (Coming Soon!)</li>
	    		<li> Video tiles (Coming Soon!)</li>
	    	</ol>    
	    	
	    	To create a new tile, press the &ldquo;New Tile&rdquo; button. This will automatically add a new tile tile to the
	    	bottom of the page. If instead you would like to edit a tile, simply click on it and choose whether you would like
	    	to edit its contents, or delete it. <br /> <br />
	    	
	    	Every story has an ending, and in a Choose Your Adventure book every page is a potential ending. That is why you are
	    	asked to put an ending on each page. To do this, click just above the list of decisions, where the default page ending
	    	reads &ldquo;+ Add an ending to this page&rdquo;. Use this space to give the user a choice to make in the decisions below. <br /> <br />
	    	
	    	Once you have asked your readers to make a choice, you should provide them with some possible decisions to make. This happens
	    	after the tiles and the page ending, below the thick grey line. To add a choice press the button labeled &ldquo;Add a choice&rdquo;
	    	which will automatically add a new choice just below the others. To edit a choice, simply press on it and you can change what it says,
	    	as well as what page it links to. <br /><br />
